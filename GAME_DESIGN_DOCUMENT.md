# THE VEIL BETWEEN US
## A Game Design Document for Long-Distance Best Friends

*"Some friendships exist in the spaces between worlds."*

---

## 1. CORE FANTASY AND EMOTIONAL INTENT

### The Central Fantasy

Two best friends exist in parallel versions of the same haunted town—one in the **Waking World** (mundane but observant), one in the **Underneath** (supernatural but blind). Neither can survive alone. Neither can see what the other sees. Together, through fragmented communication and profound trust, they navigate psychological mysteries that only their friendship can solve.

### Emotional Intent

This is not a game about winning. It is a game about **proving you know someone**.

The core emotional loop exploits the unique pain and beauty of long-distance friendship:
- The yearning to share experiences you can't fully explain
- The terror of drifting apart without realizing it
- The profound relief when someone truly *gets* you without words
- The intimacy of shared silence

**What players should feel:**
- Quietly understood
- Productively vulnerable
- Intellectually stimulated
- Emotionally held
- Slightly unsettled (in a delicious way)

### The Brutal Truth

This game will not appeal to everyone. It is slow. It rewards patience. It punishes impatience with emotional distance, not game-over screens. The target audience is two people who already love each other and want a ritual to maintain that love across geography.

---

## 2. DETAILED GAMEPLAY LOOP

### Session Structure (15-25 minutes)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PHASE 1: THE DRIFT (2-3 min)                                   │
│  Players explore separately, building tension and information   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PHASE 2: THE REACHING (5-8 min)                                │
│  Limited communication unlocks; players exchange fragments      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PHASE 3: THE CONVERGENCE (5-10 min)                            │
│  Players must act in synchrony based on shared understanding    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PHASE 4: THE ECHO (2-3 min)                                    │
│  Reflection, revelation of what each player experienced         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Scenario System

Each session presents a **Haunting**—a psychological mystery manifesting differently in each world.

**Example Haunting: "The Collector"**

*Waking World Player sees:*
- A Victorian house with rooms that rearrange when you're not looking
- Portraits of people whose eyes follow you
- A journal with entries in handwriting that changes
- Subtle sounds: breathing, footsteps, a music box

*Underneath Player experiences:*
- The same house, but decayed and flooded with black water
- The portraits are empty frames with whispers emerging
- The journal is blank but radiates emotional impressions (grief, rage, longing)
- They can see a figure moving, but not where it goes

**The Solution:** Neither player has enough information alone. The Waking player can read the journal entries but not feel their emotional truth. The Underneath player can sense the ghost's emotional state but not its identity. Together, they must deduce: *Who is the ghost? What do they want? How do we give them peace?*

### Interaction Model

**Waking World Player (The Observer):**
- First-person exploration with attention mechanics
- "Looking" at objects reveals mundane details
- "Studying" (holding attention for 3+ seconds) reveals supernatural traces
- Can manipulate physical objects
- Sees the world as it appears; must infer the truth

**Underneath Player (The Sensitive):**
- Third-person exploration with emotion mechanics
- Sees emotional residue as colors and shapes
- Can "attune" to emotions to gain impressions
- Cannot manipulate objects but can pass through some barriers
- Sees the truth but cannot interact with it

### Failure States

There are no traditional fail states. Instead:

**Drift:** If players act without coordination, the Haunting becomes more chaotic. The mystery doesn't become unsolvable—it becomes *uglier*. The ghost lashes out. The resolution feels hollow. Players "complete" the session but know they could have done better.

**Disconnection:** If communication breaks down entirely, the session ends with both players pulled apart. A brief cinematic shows the worlds separating. Neither player sees the conclusion. This is rare and requires active sabotage or genuine miscommunication.

**Hollow Victory:** Players can brute-force some solutions. The game acknowledges this but marks the session as "Survived" rather than "Understood." The ghost moves on, but without peace.

---

## 3. PLAYER ROLES AND ASYMMETRY

### The Observer (Waking World)

**Aesthetic:** Wednesday Addams
- Sees the mundane world with preternatural clarity
- Dry, analytical, notices what others miss
- Has access to text, objects, physical evidence
- Limited emotional information

**Mechanics:**
- **Attention System:** A finite resource. Looking at something costs nothing. *Studying* costs attention. Attention regenerates slowly.
- **Notation:** Can mark objects/locations with simple glyphs visible to the Sensitive
- **Grounding:** Can "anchor" the Sensitive if they become overwhelmed, but only at specific locations

**Psychological Profile:**
- Rewarded for patience and methodical exploration
- Penalized for rushing or missing details
- Needs the Sensitive to make emotional sense of evidence

### The Sensitive (Underneath)

**Aesthetic:** Eleven meets gothic romance
- Sees the emotional truth behind reality
- Overwhelmed by sensation, must manage emotional exposure
- Has access to feelings, impressions, supernatural movement
- Limited factual information

**Mechanics:**
- **Exposure System:** The Underneath is intense. Staying too long in emotionally charged areas causes **Fraying**—visual distortion, unreliable information.
- **Attunement:** Can "feel into" emotional residue to gain impressions (not facts)
- **Glimpse:** Occasionally sees flashes of what the Observer sees, but distorted

**Psychological Profile:**
- Rewarded for emotional courage and intuitive leaps
- Penalized for emotional avoidance or overexposure
- Needs the Observer to provide context and grounding

### Why Asymmetry Works

Long-distance friendships already involve asymmetric information. One friend goes through something; the other hears about it. One friend processes emotions externally; the other needs silence. This game makes that asymmetry *productive*. You're not identical—you're complementary. The game proves you need each other.

---

## 4. COMMUNICATION MECHANICS AND CONSTRAINTS

### The Philosophy

Full voice chat would destroy the experience. The tension comes from *incomplete* communication—from having to trust that your friend understood, from the relief when they did, from the gentle grief when they didn't.

### Communication Channels

**1. The Whisper (Primary)**
- Text-based, but **heavily constrained**
- Each phase unlocks a limited number of "whispers" (3-5 per phase)
- Whispers have character limits (40-80 characters)
- Whispers take time to "travel" between worlds (2-3 seconds)
- Messages arrive slightly distorted: random letters may be missing or changed

*Why:* Forces economy of language. Creates the feeling of shouting across a void.

**2. The Mark (Environmental)**
- Observer can place glyphs in the Waking World
- Sensitive sees these as faint impressions
- Limited glyph vocabulary: ⚠️ 👁️ ❤️ ❓ ⬆️ ⬇️ ⭐ 💀
- Marks fade over time

*Why:* Non-verbal communication. Requires shared understanding of what symbols mean *to you*.

**3. The Pulse (Emotional)**
- Either player can send a "pulse"—a wordless signal
- Observer's pulse: a brief flicker of light in the Underneath
- Sensitive's pulse: a brief moment of cold in the Waking World
- No inherent meaning; players develop their own pulse language

*Why:* The most intimate communication. A pulse can mean "I'm okay," "I need you," "I found something," or "I love you"—depending on what you've decided together.

**4. The Echo Chamber (Post-Session)**
- After each session, players enter a shared space
- Full text chat is available here
- Players can see what the other experienced (abbreviated)
- This is where you process together

*Why:* The release valve. The game is tense; the Echo Chamber is warm.

### Communication Unlocks

As friendship progresses (tracked over sessions), communication constraints loosen slightly:
- More whispers per phase
- Longer character limits
- Shorter travel time
- Less distortion

This represents the friendship strengthening—your connection becoming clearer.

---

## 5. PSYCHOLOGICAL SYSTEMS THAT DEEPEN THE BOND

### The Memory Palace

Each friendship has a shared **Memory Palace**—a persistent space that grows with each session.

**How it works:**
- After each Haunting, players choose one "memory" to preserve
- Memories are artifacts: a phrase one player whispered, an object that mattered, a moment of synchrony
- These appear in the Memory Palace as physical objects
- Future Hauntings may reference these memories

**Emotional function:** You're building a history together. The game remembers what mattered to you.

### The Knowing Score

Invisible to players, the game tracks **mutual understanding**:

- Did the Observer's marks match what the Sensitive needed?
- Did the Sensitive's emotional reads help the Observer?
- Did pulses align with meaningful moments?
- Did whispers convey truth despite distortion?

High Knowing Scores unlock:
- More poetic/complex Hauntings
- Narrative callbacks to previous sessions
- Special "Resonance" moments where both players see the same thing simultaneously

**This is never shown as a number.** Players only feel it through the game's response to them.

### The Vulnerability System

Some Hauntings include **Vulnerability Prompts**—optional moments where the game asks players to share something real.

Examples:
- "The ghost is afraid of being forgotten. What do you fear losing?"
- "The letters reveal a broken promise. Have you ever broken a promise to each other?"
- "The child in the photograph is alone. When did you last feel truly alone?"

**Rules:**
- These are always optional
- Responses are private unless players choose to share
- The game acknowledges vulnerability with small narrative rewards
- Never stored, never analyzed, never monetized

**Emotional function:** The game creates *excuses* for vulnerability that feel safer than direct conversation.

### Drift Detection

The game notices patterns:
- If one player always leads and one always follows
- If whispers become perfunctory
- If sessions end in Hollow Victory repeatedly
- If time between sessions grows

**Response:** Gentle narrative nudges. A Haunting about two friends who drifted apart. A ghost who regrets not reaching out. Never preachy—always through story.

---

## 6. REPLAYABILITY AND LONG-TERM PROGRESSION

### The Haunting Library

**Launch content:** 12 unique Hauntings across 3 "seasons"
**Post-launch:** New Hauntings added monthly; community-created Hauntings eventually

Each Haunting has:
- Multiple possible resolutions (not all equal)
- Variations based on which player sees what
- Callbacks to previous sessions
- Different emotional tones (grief, guilt, longing, rage, peace)

### Friendship Levels

Not gamified. No XP bars. Instead:

**The Thread**
- A visual representation of the friendship
- Starts as a thin, fragile line between two distant points
- Grows stronger, more complex, more beautiful with each session
- Visible in the Memory Palace
- If the friendship "drifts" (long gaps between sessions), the Thread shows strain—not as punishment, but as honesty

### Seasonal Arcs

Each "season" of Hauntings tells a larger story:
- Season 1: "The Disappearance" (learning to communicate)
- Season 2: "The Collector" (facing what you've lost)
- Season 3: "The Twins" (understanding your differences)

Completing a season unlocks:
- A unique shared item for the Memory Palace
- A new communication glyph
- A "duet" Haunting where roles can switch mid-session

### The Anniversary System

The game tracks:
- How long you've been playing together
- The date of your first session
- Milestones (10th session, 1-year anniversary)

On significant dates:
- A unique Haunting unlocks, available only for that pair
- The Memory Palace has special decorations
- A small narrative moment acknowledging the journey

### Real-Time Architecture

**Why WebSocket over WebRTC:**
- Simpler NAT traversal (critical for reliability)
- Server authority prevents desync
- Easier to implement communication constraints server-side
- Voice chat is intentionally absent

**State Synchronization:**
```javascript
// Simplified state model
{
  haunting: {
    id: "collector-v1",
    phase: "reaching",
    timeRemaining: 340,
    sharedState: { /* visible to both */ },
    observerState: { /* Waking World only */ },
    sensitiveState: { /* Underneath only */ }
  },
  communication: {
    whispersRemaining: 3,
    pendingMessages: [],
    marks: [],
    pulseHistory: []
  },
  friendship: {
    knowingScore: 0.72,  // Never shown to players
    memoryPalace: [...],
    threadStrength: 0.85
  }
}
```

**Latency Handling:**
- Communication delays are *intentional* (part of the aesthetic)
- Game state updates every 100ms (not frame-perfect)
- Client-side prediction for movement only
- Server authority for all meaningful actions

### Security Considerations

- **Privacy first:** Vulnerability responses never leave client
- **No analytics on content:** Only structural data (session length, completion)
- **Friendship codes expire:** Prevents unwanted joins
- **Rate limiting on communication:** Prevents spam, maintains constraint

### Offline Capability

The game requires both players online. However:
- Memory Palace viewable offline
- Previous session summaries available
- "Leave a Memory" feature: record a short message for when friend comes online

## 8. UX TONE AND NARRATIVE VOICE GUIDELINES

### Visual Language

**Color Palette:**
```css
:root {
  /* Waking World */
  --waking-bg: #1a1a2e;        /* Deep navy */
  --waking-accent: #e6d5ac;    /* Aged paper */
  --waking-highlight: #8b7355; /* Worn wood */
  
  /* Underneath */
  --under-bg: #0d0d0d;         /* True black */
  --under-accent: #4a5568;     /* Ash */
  --under-highlight: #9f7aea;  /* Bruised violet */
  
  /* Shared */
  --connection: #f6ad55;       /* Warm amber (rare, precious) */
  --danger: #c53030;           /* Muted red (not alarming) */
  --text: #e2e8f0;             /* Soft white */
}
```

**Typography:**
- Headers: Playfair Display (elegant, literary)
- Body: Source Sans Pro (readable, modern)
- Whispers: EB Garamond italic (handwritten feel)

**Animation Philosophy:**
- Slow, deliberate transitions
- Never snappy or bouncy
- Ease-in-out-cubic for everything
- Micro-interactions should feel like breathing

### Audio Design

**Waking World:**
- Quiet. Almost silent.
- Distant sounds: a clock ticking, wind, floor creaking
- Music: sparse piano, single notes with long decay
- Never sudden; always approaching

**Underneath:**
- Dense. Overwhelming if unmanaged.
- Layered drones, reversed audio, whispers at the edge of hearing
- Music: cello drones, dissonant harmonics
- Sensitive's "Fraying" increases audio chaos

**Shared Moments:**
- When players connect (pulse acknowledged, mark seen): a brief, warm tone
- Both players hear it. It means: "They're there."

### Writing Style

**The Narrator Voice:**
- Omniscient but not intrusive
- Speaks in second person ("You notice...")
- Never explains emotions; describes sensations
- Dry wit, occasional dark humor
- Assumes intelligence; never patronizes

**Examples:**

*Good:*
> "The photograph is face-down. This tells you nothing and everything."

> "Your whisper arrives. Whether it helps is not for you to know."

> "The ghost was a child once. So were you. This is the only thing you have in common."

*Bad:*
> "You feel sad looking at the photograph."

> "Great job! Your message was received!"

> "This ghost is just like you—lonely and misunderstood!"

**Haunting Descriptions:**
- Begin with a sensory image
- Never explain the puzzle
- End with a question or implication

*Example:*
> "The nursery hasn't been opened in forty years. The dust knows this. The mobile above the crib still turns, slowly, though there is no wind. Something here is waiting. Something here has always been waiting."

### UI Principles

1. **Minimal chrome:** Interface should feel like it's barely there
2. **Diegetic where possible:** Information embedded in the world
3. **No tutorials:** Discovery is part of the experience
4. **Error states are narrative:** "The connection wavers" not "Connection error"
5. **Loading is atmosphere:** Not a spinner—a slow fade, ambient sound

---

## 9. MONETIZATION THAT DOES NOT DISRUPT INTIMACY

### Philosophy

This game is about friendship. Monetization that creates inequality, pressure, or interruption would be violence against the core experience. The business model must be *invisible during play*.

### Model: "Patronage"

**Free Tier:**
- 3 Hauntings (full experience, not demos)
- Memory Palace (limited size)
- All communication features
- No ads, no interruptions, no timers

**The Veil ($9/month or $72/year):**
- Full Haunting library (12+ and growing)
- Unlimited Memory Palace
- Seasonal content on release
- Custom glyphs
- Anniversary features
- **One subscription covers both friends**

This is critical: if one friend subscribes, both benefit. The game does not distinguish between subscribers in-session. No "premium player" indicators. The subscription is a gift to the friendship, not a status symbol.

**One-Time Purchases:**
- Physical Memory Box ($45): A mailed package with a printed Memory Palace, custom postcards, and a small artifact representing the Thread
- Anniversary Print ($25): A custom illustration based on your Memory Palace
- Support the Devs ($5-50): Pure patronage, no in-game benefit

### Why This Works

- **No pay-to-win:** There's nothing to win
- **No cosmetic flex:** The other player is your friend; they don't need impressing
- **No pressure:** Free tier is genuinely substantial
- **Shared value:** Subscription benefits both, reinforcing the "we're in this together" theme

## 10. WHY THIS WORKS FOR LONG-DISTANCE BEST FRIENDS

### The Specific Problem

Long-distance friendships die slowly from:
1. **Scheduling friction:** Hard to find time for calls
2. **Conversation decay:** "How are you?" "Fine." "Same."
3. **Experience divergence:** Lives stop overlapping
4. **Guilt spiral:** Feel bad about not reaching out, so don't reach out
5. **Replacement:** Local friends fill the void

### How This Game Addresses Each

1. **Scheduling friction:**
   - Sessions are 15-25 minutes. Shorter than a phone call.
   - Asynchronous "Leave a Memory" for when you can't sync.
   - The game creates *urgency* without *pressure*.

2. **Conversation decay:**
   - You don't have to make conversation. The game gives you something to *do*.
   - Post-session Echo Chamber naturally generates real conversation.
   - Vulnerability prompts create openings that feel safe.

3. **Experience divergence:**
   - The game IS the shared experience. You're living through it together.
   - Memory Palace accumulates shared history.
   - Inside jokes emerge from specific Hauntings.

4. **Guilt spiral:**
   - The Thread visualization shows friendship state *without judgment*.
   - Gentle narrative nudges feel like care, not nagging.
   - Coming back after a gap is celebrated, not penalized.

5. **Replacement:**
   - The game is for *this* friendship, not a social network.
   - Progress and memories are specific to you two.
   - Local friends can't substitute; they haven't built the Memory Palace.

### The Deeper Truth

This game works because it understands that long-distance friendships need *ritual*. Not just communication—ritual. A scheduled time. A shared activity. A reason to be present with each other despite the miles.

The game is the ritual.

The ghosts are just an excuse.

What you're really doing is proving, session after session, that you still know each other. That the distance hasn't changed you. That when the world goes dark, you can still find each other through the Veil.

## APPENDIX A: SAMPLE HAUNTING — "THE UNFINISHED LETTER"

### Setup

A small post office in a town that no longer exists. It burned down in 1952. Letters that were never delivered still wait in the dead letter office.

### Observer Experience (Waking World)

The post office is intact but frozen. Dust covers everything. The clock reads 3:47—always 3:47.

**Explorable elements:**
- A sorting desk with hundreds of letters
- A logbook with names and addresses
- A photograph of the postmaster and his daughter
- A locked drawer (requires combination)
- A calendar marked "March 15" with no year

**Key letter (requires finding):**
Addressed to "My Dearest Eleanor" with no sender name. Half-written. Ends mid-sentence: "I need you to know that what happened was—"

### Sensitive Experience (Underneath)

The post office is charred and broken. Letters float in the air like leaves. Everything is cold.

**Explorable elements:**
- Emotional residue: overwhelming grief near the sorting desk
- A figure (the postmaster) pacing, unable to leave
- Whispers that form words if you attune long enough
- The locked drawer glows with longing
- Eleanor's presence—she's been here, looking for something

**Key impression (requires attuning):**
The postmaster is not haunting the post office. He's haunting the letter. He died before he could finish it. Eleanor never knew.

### Resolution Paths

**Full Understanding (requires coordination):**
- Observer finds the letter and reads it aloud (via whisper, fragmented)
- Sensitive attunes to the postmaster and conveys his emotional state
- Together they deduce: the postmaster loved Eleanor; she loved him; neither said it
- Observer finds the combination (hidden in the logbook: Eleanor's birthday)
- Drawer contains: Eleanor's unfinished letter to him
- Both letters are placed together on the sorting desk
- The postmaster and Eleanor's residue merge. Peace.

**Partial Understanding:**
- Players find one letter but not the other
- The ghost moves on, but something remains
- The Memory Palace receives a "torn letter"—incomplete

**Hollow Victory:**
- Players brute-force the combination or skip exploration
- The postmaster "leaves" but the letters remain
- The Memory Palace receives "ash"—a reminder of what was missed

### Vulnerability Prompt (Optional)

*Appears after finding the first letter:*

"The postmaster waited too long to say what mattered. Is there something you've waited too long to say to each other?"

*The Veil Between Us* is not a game about ghosts. It's a game about the people who refuse to let distance make them strangers. The ghosts are just mirrors—reflections of the fears that haunt every long-distance friendship. The question isn't whether you can save them. It's whether, in the process, you remember why you're worth saving.

*Some friendships exist in the spaces between worlds. Yours is one of them.*
