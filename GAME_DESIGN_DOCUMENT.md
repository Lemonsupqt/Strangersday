# The Veil Between
## A Game Design Document for Long-Distance Best Friends

---

## 1. Core Fantasy and Emotional Intent

### The Core Fantasy

**"You are the only person who can feel me when I'm gone."**

Two best friends exist in parallel versions of the same haunted space—one in the Living World, one in the Beneath. You cannot see each other. You cannot speak. But you can *sense* each other through the objects you touch, the silences you share, and the patterns you leave behind.

The game asks: *How well do you really know each other?*

### Emotional Intent

This is not a game about winning. It is a game about **proving you know someone**—their rhythms, their fears, their tells. Every session is a small act of devotion: choosing to sit in the dark with your best friend, trusting that they're there even when you can't see them.

**Primary Emotional Goals:**
- **Validation**: "They noticed the small thing I did."
- **Intimacy**: "We developed our own silent language."
- **Longing satisfied**: "I felt them there with me, even though we're 3,000 miles apart."
- **Earned trust**: "I didn't panic. I waited, and they came through."

**What This Game is NOT:**
- A test of reflexes
- A competition between friends
- A social experience for strangers
- Something you play while doing something else

This game demands your full attention because your best friend deserves your full attention.

```

### Phase 1: Arrival (2 minutes)

Both players enter the same environment—a decaying Victorian greenhouse, an abandoned radio station, a rain-soaked cemetery. For 30 seconds, you see each other. You can move around. You cannot speak.

Then the Veil descends.

One player is pulled into **The Beneath**—a darker, colder, more dangerous mirror of the same space. The other remains in **The Living World**—warmer, but incomplete, missing crucial information.

**The moment of separation is always jarring.** The screen flickers. The music shifts from minor to dissonant. Your friend's silhouette lingers for a moment, then vanishes.

You are alone. But not really.

### Phase 2: The Haunt (15-20 minutes)

This is the core gameplay. A mystery must be solved:
- A ghost needs something remembered
- A door needs the right sequence
- A name needs to be uncovered
- Someone—or something—needs to be found

**The catch:** Neither player has all the information. The Living World contains *context* (photographs, letters, dates). The Beneath contains *truth* (what actually happened, where things are hidden, what the dead remember).

**Communication happens through indirect means:**

| Living World Player | Beneath Player |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Can light candles that flicker in the Beneath | Can extinguish candles in patterns |
| Can arrange objects that cast shadows across the Veil | Can move through shadows to reach new areas |
| Can play music that the Beneath player hears distorted | Can sing back (humming only) through static |
| Sees time moving forward | Sees time frozen or moving backward |

**Example Gameplay:**

*The Living World player finds a photograph of a family, but the mother's face is burned away. They arrange four candles in a square—their agreed-upon signal for "I found something important."*

*The Beneath player sees four flames appear, ghostly and pale. They move toward them, passing through a wall that only exists in the Living World. In the Beneath, the mother's ghost stands in that spot, repeating the same phrase in reverse.*

*The Beneath player hums three times—their signal for "I need you to do something with sound."*

*The Living World player finds an old phonograph and plays the record. In the Beneath, the ghost stops. Turns. Points to a specific grave.*

*The players have found the next piece of the puzzle.*

### Phase 3: Reunion (3 minutes)

When the mystery is solved—or the Haunt's time runs out—the Veil thins.

For one minute, both players can see each other again, standing in the same space. No words. No interface.

The game asks: **"What did you learn about each other tonight?"**

Each player writes one sentence—privately—about what they noticed their friend do. These are stored, never shown to the other player, but used by the game to adapt future sessions.

## 3. Player Roles and Asymmetry

### The Keeper (Living World)

**Fantasy:** The one who holds onto what was. The archivist. The one who refuses to forget.

**Abilities:**
- Can manipulate light (candles, lamps, mirrors)
- Can read documents and examine photographs
- Can play recorded sound
- Can arrange objects in the physical space
- Time moves forward normally

**Limitations:**
- Cannot see what's hidden
- Cannot hear the dead
- Cannot pass through walls
- Must trust what they cannot verify

**Psychological Role:** The Keeper must be *patient*. They are always waiting for a sign, trusting that their friend is working on something. They must resist the urge to do more, to fill silence with action.

**Ideal for:** The friend who tends to be the "planner," the organizer, the one who keeps the friendship's history.

---

### The Witness (The Beneath)

**Fantasy:** The one who sees what others refuse to. The one who walks with ghosts.

**Abilities:**
- Can see through the Veil (but only in shadows)
- Can hear the dead speak
- Can touch memory-objects that reveal the past
- Can move through spaces that are "blocked" in the Living World
- Time is unstable—can see moments from multiple times

**Limitations:**
- Cannot manipulate the physical world directly
- Sound comes through distorted
- The longer they stay in one place, the colder they get (a timer mechanic)
- Must rely on the Keeper to anchor them

**Psychological Role:** The Witness must be *brave*. They are often alone in frightening spaces, trusting that their friend is watching for their signals. They must communicate through implication, not statement.

**Ideal for:** The friend who tends to be more intuitive, who notices emotional undercurrents, who isn't afraid of silence.

---

### Role Switching

Every session, players swap roles. The game tracks which role each player has taken and gently encourages balance:

*"Margot has been the Witness for three sessions. Perhaps tonight, she needs someone to walk the Beneath for her."*

This ensures both friends experience both sides of the relationship metaphor—sometimes you are the one holding space, sometimes you are the one who needs to be seen.

---

## 4. Communication Mechanics and Constraints

### The Philosophy of Constrained Communication

Direct communication (voice, text) is not available during The Haunt. This is intentional.

**Why:**
1. **Scarcity creates meaning.** When you can say anything, nothing matters. When you can only signal, every signal matters.
2. **It mirrors long-distance friendship.** You can't always explain yourself. Sometimes you just have to trust that they understand.
3. **It creates stories.** "Remember when I hummed three times and you IMMEDIATELY knew what I meant?" These become inside jokes.

---

### Communication Channels

#### 1. The Candle Language
The Keeper can light up to 5 candles. The Witness sees them as ghostly flames.

**Base Signals (taught in the first session):**
- 1 candle: "I'm here."
- 2 candles: "Yes."
- 3 candles: "No."
- Extinguished candle (by Witness): "Acknowledged."

**The genius:** The game NEVER teaches more than these. Any additional signals must be invented by the players themselves. Over time, each pair develops their own dialect.

*After 10 sessions, Sarah and Mike have developed:*
- *4 candles in a square: "I found something important."*
- *5 candles in a line: "Come to where I am."*
- *Rapid flicker: "Danger—not here."*

#### 2. The Humming Channel
The Witness can hum—but it comes through to the Keeper as distorted, almost-musical static.

**Mechanics:**
- Short hum: Comes through as a brief burst of static
- Long hum: Comes through as a sustained tone
- Rhythm persists, pitch does not

**Example:** The Witness hums the rhythm of "shave and a haircut"—the Keeper hears it as static, but recognizes the pattern.

#### 3. Object Arrangement
The Keeper can arrange objects. The Witness sees them as shadowy impressions—they can tell *something* was arranged, but details are fuzzy.

**Uses:**
- Pointing toward a direction
- Creating a number (4 objects = look at the 4th thing)
- Leaving an object in a specific location as a marker

#### 4. The Shadow Pass
When both players stand in the same location—one in the Living World, one in the Beneath—they can briefly see each other's silhouette.

**This is precious.** It only lasts 3 seconds. It cannot be forced. It happens when it happens.

**Players learn to use it deliberately:** "Meet me at the grandfather clock when you see my signal."

---

### What Players CANNOT Do

- Voice chat during The Haunt
- Text chat ever
- Point, gesture, or make direct references
- Use any signal the game teaches (beyond the 3 basic candle signals)

**The entire communication system must be earned through play.**

---

## 5. Psychological Systems That Deepen the Bond

### System 1: The Memory Garden

Every session ends with each player writing one private observation about their friend:

*"They hesitated before entering the nursery. I think dolls scare them."*

*"They found the solution before I even finished signaling. They know how I think."*

These observations are never shown to the other player. But the game uses them.

**How it manifests:**
- If you noted your friend hesitates around dolls, a future Haunt might include a doll-heavy room—and the game watches whether you signal "danger" to them more quickly.
- If you noted they're great at pattern recognition, the game might make patterns harder when they're the Witness, trusting they'll handle it.

**The psychological effect:** You feel known. The game feels like it understands your friendship—because it does. It's built from your own observations of each other.

---

### System 2: The Trust Score (Hidden)

The game secretly tracks:
- How quickly you respond to your friend's signals
- Whether you wait for confirmation or act alone
- Whether you go toward them when they seem stuck or give them space
- Whether you signal "I'm here" during long silences

This creates a hidden **Trust Score** for each player toward the other.

**What it affects:**
- Low trust = The Veil is thicker. Communication is harder. The game is testing whether you'll work for it.
- High trust = Occasional gifts. A brief flash where you see clearly into the other world. A moment where you can hear their actual humming, not static.

**The genius:** The game never tells you about Trust Score. You simply notice that sometimes, the game is kinder. You assume it's because you're getting better. You're half right—you're getting better *at being a friend.*

---

### System 3: The Things They Carried

Each player can bring ONE object from the real world into the game. Not a game object—a *real* object.

**How it works:**
1. Before a session, each player uploads a photo of something meaningful to them.
2. During The Haunt, a stylized version of that object appears somewhere in the world.
3. The OTHER player can interact with it, and the game asks: "What do you think this means to them?"

**Example:**
*Alex uploads a photo of a worn paperback copy of "The Secret History." During the Haunt, Jade (the Witness) finds a ghostly book on a shelf. The game asks: "What do you think this means to Alex?"*

*Jade types: "It's the book we both read in college. We used to quote it at each other."*

*The game doesn't tell Alex what Jade wrote. But it stores it. On their friendship anniversary (a date the game knows), it shows Alex all the things Jade has written about their objects—a gift.*

---

### System 4: The Unspoken Ritual

After 5 sessions, the game asks both players (separately):

*"Is there something you do at the start of every session? A pattern? A greeting?"*

If both players describe the same thing—however approximately—the game acknowledges it:

*"The Archive has noticed a ritual between you. The lighting of a candle in the southwest corner at the beginning of each Haunt. This is now sacred ground. A candle lit there will burn twice as bright."*

**The psychological effect:** The game is *watching* your friendship and honoring it. Your private rituals become mechanically meaningful. The game becomes *yours* in a way no other copy of the game is anyone else's.

---

## 6. Replayability and Long-Term Progression

### The Haunting Calendar

The game is designed for **weekly sessions**, like a TV show you watch together.

Each week, a new Haunt is available—a new location, a new mystery, a new ghost. But the Haunts are connected. Characters recur. References accumulate. By session 10, you're not just solving a mystery—you're uncovering a larger conspiracy that spans decades.

**Structure:**
- **Sessions 1-5:** Tutorial arc. Learn the mechanics. Establish your signals.
- **Sessions 6-15:** The First Season. A complete narrative with an ending.
- **Sessions 16+:** The Long Haunt. Procedurally-influenced mysteries that incorporate everything the game has learned about you.

---

### Friendship Artifacts

Every 5 sessions, the game creates a **Friendship Artifact**: a shareable image that encodes your journey.

**Example Artifact:**

These can be saved, printed, framed. They become artifacts of the friendship itself.

---

### The Anniversary Haunt

On the anniversary of your first session, a special Haunt unlocks. It takes place in **your own Archive**—a location built from every object you've uploaded, every observation you've made, every ritual you've established.

The ghost is not a stranger. The ghost is **the version of your friendship that existed a year ago.** You must help it remember what it's become.

---

### Long-Term Unlocks

| Sessions | Unlock |
|----------|--------|
| 5 | Custom candle colors |
| 10 | The ability to hum actual notes (pentatonic scale) |
| 15 | A "home base" location you can return to between Haunts |
| 20 | The Shadow Pass lasts 5 seconds instead of 3 |
| 30 | You can bring TWO objects from the real world |
| 50 | The Keeper can briefly enter the Beneath (10 seconds) |

These unlocks are **never** purchasable. They can only be earned by continuing to show up for each other.

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend
```
Framework:      Vue 3 + TypeScript (for reactivity without React's overhead)
Rendering:      PixiJS for 2D environments (performant, atmospheric)
Audio:          Tone.js for procedural audio + Howler.js for samples
State:          Pinia (lightweight, perfect for game state)
Animation:      GSAP for smooth, cinematic transitions
Styling:        CSS custom properties + hand-crafted dark palette
```

#### Backend
```
Runtime:        Node.js (Bun for performance if stable)
Framework:      Fastify (lower overhead than Express)
Real-time:      Socket.io (WebSocket with fallbacks)
P2P:            PeerJS (WebRTC wrapper for data channels)
Database:       PostgreSQL (friendship data, progression)
Cache:          Redis (session state, matchmaking)
Auth:           Magic links (no passwords—email only)
Hosting:        Fly.io (edge deployment, low latency)
```

#### Data Model (Simplified)

```typescript
// Core entities

interface Friendship {
  id: string;
  player_a_id: string;
  player_b_id: string;
  created_at: Date;
  sessions_completed: number;
  trust_score_a: number;  // A's trust in B (hidden)
  trust_score_b: number;  // B's trust in A (hidden)
  rituals: Ritual[];
  artifacts: Artifact[];
}

interface Session {
  id: string;
  friendship_id: string;
  haunt_id: string;
  started_at: Date;
  completed_at: Date | null;
  keeper_id: string;
  witness_id: string;
  signals_exchanged: SignalEvent[];
  mystery_solved: boolean;
  observations: Observation[];  // Private, per-player
}

interface SignalEvent {
  timestamp: Date;
  sender_role: 'keeper' | 'witness';
  signal_type: 'candle' | 'hum' | 'object' | 'shadow_pass';
  data: Record<string, any>;
  response_time_ms: number | null;  // How fast partner responded
}

interface Observation {
  session_id: string;
  author_id: string;
  about_player_id: string;
  text: string;
  sentiment: 'positive' | 'neutral' | 'concern';  // ML-classified
  referenced_in_future_haunt: boolean;
}
```

### Real-Time Synchronization

**Philosophy:** The game is slow enough that perfect sync isn't critical. Prioritize *feeling* connected over technical precision.

## 8. UX Tone and Narrative Voice Guidelines

### Visual Identity

**Palette:**
```
Background:     #0a0a0f (Almost black, warm undertone)
Primary:        #c9b8a3 (Aged paper, warm)
Accent:         #7a5c4a (Dried blood, muted)
Danger:         #4a1c1c (Deep red, never bright)
Trust:          #3d5a5a (Teal, barely visible)
Text:           #e8e4df (Cream, easy on eyes)

NEVER USE: Pure white, neon colors, high saturation
```

**Typography:**
```
Headers:        EB Garamond (serif, literary)
Body:           Inter (clean, readable)
UI:             JetBrains Mono (technical elements only)

Atmosphere is created through restraint, not ornamentation.
```

**Visual Effects:**
- Grain overlay (subtle, 5% opacity, animated)
- Vignette (heavier during tense moments)
- Chromatic aberration (only during Veil transitions)
- NO bloom, NO lens flare, NO particle explosions

---

### Narrative Voice

The game speaks to you directly, but rarely. When it does, it sounds like:

**✓ This:**
> "The Veil thins. They are close."

> "You waited. That was the right thing to do."

> "Something has changed between you. The Archive has noticed."

**✗ Not this:**
> "Great job! You solved the puzzle!"

> "Your friend needs help—hurry!"

> "Achievement Unlocked: First Haunt!"

**Voice Principles:**
1. **Assume intelligence.** Never explain what the player can figure out.
2. **Acknowledge emotion, don't create it.** The game notices; it doesn't manipulate.
3. **Be literary, not flowery.** Short sentences. Specificity over abstraction.
4. **Embrace silence.** Most of the game has no narration at all.

---

### Wednesday Addams Inspiration

The game's personality is:
- **Dry.** If it makes a joke, it doesn't signal that it's a joke.
- **Observant.** It notices what you do, even when you think no one's watching.
- **Loyal.** Once you're in, you're in. The game is on your side.
- **Morbid without being grim.** Death is present, but it's the death of memories, relationships, secrets—not gore.

**Example interaction:**

*The player examines a portrait of a severe-looking woman.*

> "Edith Marsh. 1847-1891. She watched this house for forty years. She's still watching."

*Not:*

> "This is a painting of Edith Marsh! She was the original owner of this house. Spooky, right?"

---

### Stranger Things Inspiration

The game's emotional core:
- **Found family over blood.** Your friend is who you choose.
- **The monster is loneliness.** The supernatural is a metaphor for disconnection.
- **Hope persists.** Even in darkness, the other person is there.
- **Small towns, big secrets.** The Haunts feel local, specific, not generically gothic.

**Example environmental detail:**

*In the Living World, a radio plays static. In the Beneath, it plays a fragment of a song that was #1 the year both players were born.*

*Neither player knows it's personalized. It just feels right.*

## 9. Monetization That Does Not Disrupt Intimacy

### The Core Problem

Most F2P monetization exploits:
- FOMO (limited-time items)
- Social pressure (friends can see your purchases)
- Friction (pay to remove annoyances)

All of these would destroy the emotional safety this game requires.

### The Solution: Patronage, Not Purchase

**$5/month per friendship** (not per player—per pair)

Either player can pay, or they can split it. The game doesn't care. It's between them.

**What you get:**
- Access to all Haunts (weekly releases)
- All progression features
- All future content

**What you DON'T get by paying more:**
- Faster progression
- Exclusive cosmetics
- Any gameplay advantage

---

### The Free Tier

**Available forever, no credit card:**
- The first 5 sessions (complete tutorial arc)
- Permanent access to any Haunts you've completed
- Friendship Artifacts for completed sessions

**Why this works:**
- 5 sessions is enough to know if this game is for you
- No artificial walls mid-experience
- Your progress is never held hostage

---

### Optional Patronage Tiers

**$10/month: The Archivist**
- Early access to new Haunts (1 week ahead)
- Behind-the-scenes development notes
- Your name in the credits (if desired)

**$25/month: The Keeper of the Veil**
- All Archivist benefits
- Influence on future Haunt themes (quarterly surveys)
- Physical mail: Seasonal postcards from the game world

**One-Time Purchase: The Artifact ($15)**
- A high-resolution, print-ready version of your Friendship Artifact
- Suitable for framing
- Only available after 10+ sessions (must be earned first)

## 10. Why This Game Works for Long-Distance Best Friends

### The Fundamental Problem

Long-distance friendships suffer from:
1. **Attrition of shared experience.** You're no longer making memories together.
2. **Asymmetric life pacing.** One person is busy while the other is free.
3. **The tyranny of the catch-up call.** "What's new?" becomes exhausting.
4. **Loss of non-verbal intimacy.** You can't just *be* together anymore.

Most "games for friends" fail because they're actually games for strangers that friends can play together. They don't address the *specific* needs of maintaining intimate connection across distance.

---

### How The Veil Between Addresses These

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No shared experiences | Weekly sessions create ongoing shared story |
| Asymmetric schedules | 20 minutes is manageable; sessions are appointments |
| Exhausting catch-ups | No talking required—just presence |
| Loss of non-verbal intimacy | Entire game is non-verbal; you learn to feel each other |

---

### The Stranger Things / Wednesday Audience

These fandoms share:
- **Appreciation for atmospheric tension** over cheap thrills
- **Investment in character relationships** over plot
- **Comfort with darkness** that's ultimately hopeful
- **Nostalgia for sincere connection** in an ironic age

This audience doesn't want another party game. They want something that takes them seriously.

---

### The Emotional Payoff

The best moment in this game:

*You're the Keeper. Your friend has been in the Beneath for five minutes without signaling. You're worried. You light a candle in your usual spot—your ritual—and wait.*

*Nothing.*

*You light a second candle. Your signal for "Are you okay?"*

*Thirty seconds pass. Then: the first candle flickers out. The second stays lit.*

*They're okay. They're just focused. They'll signal when they're ready.*

*You sit in the dark and wait. And waiting feels like love.*

**That's the game.** Not the puzzles. Not the ghosts. The waiting. The trust that they're there, even when you can't see them.

---

### Brutal Honesty: Who This Game Is NOT For

- **Casual friendships.** If you don't already care about this person, the game will feel boring.
- **Conflict-avoidant pairs.** The game will surface patterns; you must be okay with that.
- **Achievement hunters.** There's no leaderboard, no 100% completion, no bragging rights.
- **People who need constant stimulation.** Long silences are features, not bugs.

This game is for two people who already love each other and want a new way to prove it.

## Appendix A: First Session Script

For reference during development—the exact flow of the tutorial.

```
[0:00] Both players see the same loading screen:
       "Searching for your friend in the dark..."

[0:10] Connection established. Both players appear in a candlelit foyer.
       They can see each other. No UI. No instructions.

[0:30] Narration: "You have thirty seconds. Look at them."

[1:00] Screen flickers. Narration: "The Veil descends."
       One player's screen goes cold. They are pulled into the Beneath.

[1:05] Split-screen metaphor: Living World is warm amber.
       Beneath is cold blue-gray. Same room. Different light.

[1:15] Tutorial prompts appear (minimally):
       Keeper: "Light a candle." (Shows one button)
       Witness: "Watch for the flame."

[1:30] If Keeper lights candle, Witness sees ghostly flame.
       Narration (to Witness): "They are still there."

[2:00] Narration (to Keeper): "Your friend cannot speak. Listen for them."
       Witness gets prompt: "Hum. Hold the button."

[2:15] Keeper hears static with rhythm.
       Narration (to Keeper): "That is their voice. Remember it."

[3:00] The tutorial continues for ~5 more minutes, teaching:
       - Object arrangement
       - Shadow Pass (standing in same place)
       - The concept of asymmetric information

[8:00] A simple "mystery" is presented:
       A ghost needs to remember their name.
       Letters exist in the Living World, scrambled.
       The correct order is visible only in the Beneath.

[12:00] If solved: Narration: "They are at peace. Because of both of you."
        Reunion phase begins.

[15:00] End of first session.
        "What did you notice about your friend tonight?"
        (Text input, private)

[15:30] Friendship Artifact generated.
        "Session 1 Complete. The Veil remembers."
```

## Appendix B: Sample Haunt Brief

**Haunt #7: "The Telephone Hour"**

**Location:** Abandoned telephone exchange, 1952

**The Mystery:** A switchboard operator vanished the night of a terrible storm. She was connecting two callers when the line went dead. Who was she connecting? Why did she disappear?

**Living World Elements:**
- Logbooks with partial phone numbers
- Photographs of operators (faces damaged)
- A phonograph that plays Big Band music
- Switchboard panels that can be manipulated

**Beneath Elements:**
- The ghost of the operator, repeating: "The line is open. The line is open."
- Time loops: seeing the moment of her disappearance over and over
- The two callers, visible as shadows, frozen mid-conversation
- Phone numbers that appear on walls, different each time

**Asymmetric Information:**
- Keeper has the NAMES of the callers (from logbooks)
- Witness has the CONTENT of the call (from ghostly echoes)
- Together: They must understand WHY this call was dangerous

**Emotional Core:** The operator was connecting two lovers whose families were feuding. She was killed to stop them from speaking. Your job is to complete the connection—fifty years too late.

**Mechanical Twist:** The Keeper must dial specific numbers on the switchboard while the Witness stands at corresponding locations in the Beneath. Perfect coordination required. Failure resets the time loop.

**Estimated Duration:** 18-22 minutes

## Appendix C: Trust Score Calculation

*Internal documentation—players never see this.*

```
Trust Score Formula (per player, toward partner):

BASE_SCORE = 50

Per session:
  +5 if you signaled "I'm here" within first 2 minutes
  +3 if you waited >10 seconds before acting on partner's signal
      (suggests deliberation, not reflex)
  +2 for each signal acknowledged within 30 seconds
  -5 if you never signaled during a 5+ minute period
  -3 if you solved a puzzle without waiting for partner input
  +10 if you used your ritual signal (once established)

Special modifiers:
  +15 if observation mentions something partner did for you
  +20 if observation shows concern (ML classified)
  -10 if session was abandoned mid-Haunt

Score range: 0-100
Decay: -2 per week without a session (minimum 30)

Effects:
  0-30:   The Veil is heavy. -50% signal clarity.
  31-50:  Normal gameplay.
  51-70:  Occasional clarity bonuses (+1 second Shadow Pass).
  71-90:  Rare gifts (moment of actual audio, clear vision flash).
  91-100: The Veil is thin. Both players get "golden session"
          with enhanced communication.
```

## Final Note: The Soul of the Game

This document describes mechanics, systems, and architecture. But the game isn't those things.

The game is the moment you realize your best friend, sitting 2,000 miles away, just figured out what you were trying to tell them without words.

The game is the silence that isn't awkward.

The game is proof that distance doesn't mean disconnection.

Everything in this document serves that moment. If a feature doesn't serve it, cut it.

*"The Veil Between"*
*A game about the people who wait for us in the dark.*
