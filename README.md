# The Veil Between Us

*A browser-based, real-time 2-player game for long-distance best friends who love Stranger Things and Wednesday Addams.*

> "Some friendships exist in the spaces between worlds."

## What Is This?

**The Veil Between Us** is an emotionally resonant co-op experience designed specifically for two people who already know and love each other. It's not a party game. It's not meant to be streamed. It's a private ritual for friends separated by geography who want to prove—session after session—that distance hasn't changed them.

Two players exist in parallel versions of the same haunted town. One sees the mundane world clearly; the other sees the supernatural truth. Neither can survive alone. Through fragmented communication and profound trust, they navigate psychological mysteries that only their friendship can solve.

## Core Features

- **Asymmetric Roles:** One player as The Observer (Wednesday Addams energy—dry, analytical, grounded). One as The Sensitive (Eleven vibes—emotional, supernatural, overwhelming).
  
- **Constrained Communication:** No voice chat. Limited text "whispers" that arrive distorted. Environmental marks. Wordless pulses that mean whatever you decide they mean.

- **Psychological Mysteries:** Each "Haunting" presents a ghost with unfinished business. Neither player has the full picture. Together, you piece together who they were and what they need.

- **The Memory Palace:** A persistent space that grows with every session. Your shared history becomes tangible.

- **No Fail States, Only Consequences:** You can't lose. But you can drift. You can resolve a mystery without understanding it. The game remembers.

## Target Audience

This game is for:
- Best friends separated by distance
- People who loved the emotional core of Stranger Things (the friendship, not the monsters)
- Fans of Wednesday Addams' restraint, intelligence, and macabre humor
- Anyone tired of games that require reflexes over reflection
- Two people who want an excuse to be present with each other

This game is **not** for:
- Strangers looking to matchmake
- Players seeking competitive challenge
- Anyone who wants immediate gratification
- Groups larger than 2

## Design Philosophy

> "The ghosts are just mirrors—reflections of the fears that haunt every long-distance friendship. The question isn't whether you can save them. It's whether, in the process, you remember why you're worth saving."

This game optimizes for emotional depth over mass appeal. It is slow. It rewards patience. It punishes impatience with emotional distance, not game-over screens.
